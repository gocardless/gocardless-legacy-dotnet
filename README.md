## :warning: __This API library is only for developers who already have an integration using the [Legacy GoCardless API](https://developer.gocardless.com/legacy).__

If you're starting a new integration, you should use the new [GoCardless API](https://developer.gocardless.com). 

We don't currently have a .NET API library, so you'll need to interact directly with our API by building your own HTTP requests using a library like [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org) - see our [API reference](https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference) for details.

If you're not sure whether this is the right library for you, get in touch - you can reach our developer support team at <api@gocardless.com>.

### ðŸ› Â __If you are using the Legacy GoCardless API, this client library is no longer supported__

This library isn't supported or maintained to the same high standard as our other projects, so we would advise that you don't use it to build a new integration.

If you're working with our API using .NET, you should make HTTP requests to the [legacy API](https://developer.gocardless.com/legacy) directly instead.

The source will remain available, so you can modify it to suit your requirements if you still wish to use this library.
